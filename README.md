# Statistics Calculator â€” Multi-Paradigm Implementation

This project implements a program that calculates **mean**, **median**, and **mode** for a list of integers in **three different programming paradigms**:  
- **C (Procedural)**  
- **OCaml (Functional)**  
- **Python (Object-Oriented)**  

Each implementation demonstrates the key concepts of its respective paradigm, allowing comparison of design, performance, and readability.

## ðŸ§® Features
* User specifies the **size of the list**
* Option to **enter numbers manually** or **generate random numbers**
* Random generation supports **user-defined lower and upper bounds**
